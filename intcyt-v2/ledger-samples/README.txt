# Demo inputs for cli.py ledger-run

This folder is reserved for sample config/stream files that exercise the
thermodynamic ledger CLI:

- config.json    # JSON object describing dimension, events, iterations, ...
- stream.jsonl   # JSON Lines with per-iteration vector/gamma/filtering payloads

Use the JSON snippets in thermo/README.md as templates if you create your own
demos.  The files are not committed yet to avoid bloating the repository, but
this README marks the expected layout.
